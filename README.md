# Django_webstore_app
A prototype of a webstore app I made while studying Django and Django Rest Framework. First app I made using test driven development.

Also tried testing using BS4 to locate elements order on website pages, Selenium to emulate user's behavior, debugging testing toolbar.
Learned how to work with Django signals
Tried different approaches to cashing content
